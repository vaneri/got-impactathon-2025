### Overview

**CityReport** is a modern, easy-to-use platform that empowers citizens to report infrastructure faults in streets, squares, and parks. Designed with Swedish municipalities in mind, it supports the principle of public access to information (_offentlighetsprincipen_) by registering all reports as official public documents.

Report holes in streets, broken bike paths, malfunctioning street lights, overgrown bushes, damaged benches, or any maintenance issues. With photos, GPS location, and detailed descriptions, citizens help municipalities maintain better infrastructure and respond faster to community needs.

**üåç Our Mission**

CityReport makes infrastructure fault reporting simple, transparent, and impactful. By giving everyone a voice to report problems, we enable faster response times, better resource allocation, and measurable community improvements. Every report contributes to safer streets, cleaner parks, and better-maintained public spaces.
